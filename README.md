# R-Coffee
Are you tired of burning yourself every time you drink your coffee or tea ? Don't panic ! The R-Coffee will solve this problem for you !

There is nothing more annoying than getting burned by a tea that is too hot or a coffee that has been forgotten and therefore too cold to drink.
So, I made a little project on a Raspberry Pi 3B that will make your life easier.

To achieve this, I used :
- 1 captor Seesaw i2c Soil
- 1 captor Sensor BME 280
- 1 keyboard
- 1 mouse
- 1 screen
- 1 adaptator Qwiic pHat
- 1 mug
- Coffee, tea... or water why not ? 🙂

**"According to the WHO, the risk of burns is present from 50 ° C when drinking coffee."**
